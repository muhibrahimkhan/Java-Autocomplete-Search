Java Autocomplete Search

This project is a simple Java autocomplete program that suggests words as you type â€” like a search engine. It uses binary search and sorting algorithms to quickly find and rank matches by weight. A Swing-based GUI lets you see results update in real time and open selected terms directly in Google Search.

ðŸš€ Features
Fast prefix search using binary search
Suggestions sorted by relevance (weight)
Real-time GUI with dropdown suggestions
Click a result to search on Google
Clean and modular object-oriented design

ðŸ§  How It Works
The program reads words and weights from a data file.
When you type a prefix, it finds all matching words.
Results are sorted by weight and displayed instantly
